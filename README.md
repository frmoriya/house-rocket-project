# 1. Business Problem

The company plans to operate in the King County city and the CEO needs anwer two questions:

1) What apartment house should buy and what is a purchase price?
2) When is the best time to sell the property and what price?  


# 2. Undestanding the Business

Classification of construction degree and condition of the building according to King Country, USA:
https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/esales/Glossary.aspx?type=r


## Building Condition:

Relative to age and grade. Coded 1-5.

1 = Poor- Worn out. Repair and overhaul needed on painted surfaces, roofing, plumbing, heating and numerous functional inadequacies. Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction; reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.

2 = Fair- Badly worn. Much repair needed. Many items need refinishing or overhauling, deferred maintenance obvious, inadequate building utility and systems all shortening the life expectancy and increasing the effective age.

3 = Average- Some evidence of deferred maintenance and normal obsolescence with age in that a few minor repairs are needed, along with some refinishing. All major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy. Effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.

4 = Good- No obvious maintenance required but neither is everything new. Appearance and utility are above the standard and the overall effective age will be lower than the typical property.

5= Very Good- All items well maintained, many having been overhauled and repaired as they have shown signs of wear, increasing the life expectancy and lowering the effective age with little deterioration or obsolescence evident with a high degree of utility.


## Undestanding the real estate market and seasonality

What are the slowest months for real estate?

The number of homes sold usually increase in the spring season. The sales of houses between February and March increase 24%, followed by the busiest months of May, June, July and August. In contrast, the slowest months are November, December, January and February.

To identify the months of seasonality, we calculate the weeks/month.

| January = 4 Wk | February = 5 Wk | March = 5 Wk | April = 4 Wk | May = 4 Wk | June = 5 Wk |
 ---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|July = 4 Wk | August = 5 Wk | September = 4 Wk | October = 4 Wk | November = 5 Wk | December = 4 Wk |


|  Winter | Spring | Summer | Fall |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| December-January-February | March-April-May | June-July-August| September-October-November |
| ... 1 ... - ... 8 ... - ... 13 ... | ... 14 ... - ... 22 ... - ... 26 ... | ...27... - ... 35 ... - ... 42 ... | ... 43 ... - ... 48 ... - ... 54 ... |

# 3. Business Assumptions

To project development we will assume the following premises:

- Delete duplicate id from dataset
- Delete inconsistency data from dataset
- The "price" column will be considered the purchase amount

# 4. Solution Planning

Deliverables:
- Deliver apartment house buy/sell suggestions in a CSV file.
- Identify 3 Business insights
- View apartment house location on city map
- Provide the solution in the cloud

## Phases to development

### Step 01. Data Collect:

- The database is available on the Kaggle website. The Data refers to apartment house for sale in Country King, USA.
- CSV file: "kc_house_data.csv" 

  https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/metadata


### Step 02: Cleaning Data:

- Delete duplicate ID
- Delete inconsistency data

### Step 03: Exploration Data: 
Data analysis for type conversion

### Step 04: Resolution of the Business Question 1:

    - Find the median property price. We will use the median because the variance in property values is high.
    - Comparing house prices with the median price
    - Recommend the purchase of houses with a price below the median price and good condition.
    - Export Suggestion purchase to CSV file

### Setp 05: Resolution of the Business Question 2:

    - Find the median property price
    - Group properties by zipcode and seasonality
    - Find the media price by zipcode and seasonality
    
    Condition to Sell house:

    1) If the purchase price is higher than the median price(by zipcode/seasonality): The sale price = purchase price + 10%
    2) If the purchase price is less than the median price(by zipcode/seasonality): The sale price = purchase price + 30%

### Step 06: Getting the geographic coordinates (lat, Long): 

 Address identification through geographic coordinates and configure the city map

### Step 07: Deploying in the cloud
